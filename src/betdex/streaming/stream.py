class BetDexStream:
    """
    One connection to the BetDEX Stream API.

    Subscriptions are remembered, and sent on every connect; ``start`` connects
    if needed, then hands each frame to the listener until ``stop``.
    Nothing reconnects by itself: when the socket fails ``start`` raises
    ``BetDexSocketError``, and calling it again reconnects and resubscribes. The
    stream can't resume, so anything sent while disconnected is lost.

    :param conn: Supplies the access token and the default app and wallet ids.
    :param listener: Receives every frame.
    :param url: Stream URL; defaults to ``conn.stream_url``.
    :param timeout: Seconds to wait to connect, or for the authentication reply.
    :param keepalive: Seconds without a frame before sending a ping; ``None``
        never pings. The gateway closes connections idle for 10 minutes.

    The API allows 10 connections and 500 active subscriptions per app, and 500
    subscriptions a minute. Each id counts as one subscription, so subscribe to
    ``"*"`` rather than to hundreds of markets one by one. The SDK doesn't
    enforce these limits.
